              <p>
                We understand the importance of providing content that's appropriate for your child's 
                age and developmental stage. Our games are organized by grade level to help you find

                Each game includes information about the target age range and the specific skills it helps 
                develop. We recommend starting with games at your child's current grade level and adjusting 
                based on their individual abilities and interests.

                <h4>Parent Tip:</h4>
                <p>
                  Observe your child while they play. If a game seems too challenging and causes frustration, 
                  try a simpler version. If they master a game quickly, they might be ready for more advanced content.

              <h2>Balancing Screen Time</h2>
              <p>
                While educational games can be valuable learning tools, we encourage a balanced approach 
                to screen time. Here are some guidelines to help you establish healthy digital habits:
              </p>
              <ul className="checklist">
                <li>Set clear time limits for game play (e.g., 20-30 minutes per session)</li>
                <li>Balance digital activities with physical play, reading, and social interaction</li>
                <li>Use games as a supplement to, not a replacement for, other learning activities</li>
                <li>Play together with your child when possible to make it a social experience</li>
                <li>Avoid screen time right before bedtime as it can interfere with sleep</li>
                <li>Take breaks to rest eyes and move around</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends limiting screen time to 1 hour per day of 
                high-quality content for children ages 2-5, with consistent limits for older children. 
                What matters most is not just the quantity of screen time, but the quality of the content 
                and your involvement in your child's digital experiences.

                young children during their online activities and having ongoing conversations about 
                internet safety.

                Our games can be a valuable part of your child's learning journey at home. Here are some

                  <h4>Connect games to real-world learning</h4>
                  <p>
                    If your child plays a math game, look for opportunities to apply those concepts in 
                    daily activities like cooking, shopping, or building projects.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Engage your child in conversation about what they're learning. Ask them to explain 
                    how they solved a problem or what they discovered while playing.

                </li>

                  <h4>Set learning goals</h4>
                  <p>
                    Work with your child to set specific learning goals and select games that help them 
                    practice those skills. Celebrate their progress!
